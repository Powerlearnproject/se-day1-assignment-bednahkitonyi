List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – Define goals, scope, and feasibility.
Requirement Analysis – Gather and document user needs.
Design – Create system architecture and UI/UX.
Implementation – Develop and integrate code.
Testing – Identify and fix bugs to ensure quality.
Deployment – Release software for users.
Maintenance – Monitor, update, and improve performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Definition
Waterfall: A linear and sequential methodology where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile: An iterative and incremental approach where development happens in small cycles (sprints), allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation.

Flexibility
Waterfall: Rigid and structured; changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed.
Agile: Highly flexible; changes and refinements can be incorporated throughout the development process.

Project Scope & Requirements
Waterfall: Requires clear and well-defined requirements upfront, with minimal scope for changes.
Agile: Allows evolving requirements, making it suitable for projects with uncertain or changing needs.

Waterfall: Delivers the final product at the end of the project timeline, which can be long.
Agile: Delivers working increments of the product frequently, enabling faster feedback and early releases.

Customer Involvement
Waterfall: Limited customer involvement after the initial requirement-gathering phase.
Agile: Continuous customer feedback is integral throughout the development process

Risk Management
Waterfall: High risk since issues are identified late in the process.
Agile: Lower risk due to continuous testing, feedback, and iterative improvements.

Testing Approach
Waterfall: Testing happens after development is completed.
Agile: Testing is integrated throughout the development cycle (continuous testing).

Best Suited For
Waterfall: Well-defined, predictable projects (e.g., government projects, construction, hardware development).
Agile: Complex, dynamic projects requiring flexibility (e.g., software development, startups, product innovations).

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Definition of Prompt Engineering  
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, ensuring that the responses generated are accurate, relevant, and useful. It involves structuring queries, using specific keywords, and sometimes employing techniques like few-shot learning or chain-of-thought prompting to guide the AI’s output.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interactions

1. Enhancing Response Quality 
   Well-crafted prompts lead to clearer, more precise responses, reducing ambiguity and increasing the AI's effectiveness in providing useful answers.

2. Maximizing AI Capabilities  
   AI models, like ChatGPT, have vast knowledge but require well-structured prompts to extract the most relevant information. Effective prompting helps unlock their full potential.

3. Reducing Misinterpretation
   Poorly designed prompts can lead to vague, incorrect, or misleading responses. Proper prompt engineering minimizes misunderstandings.

4. Improving Efficiency  
   Clear and concise prompts save time by reducing back-and-forth clarification, making interactions smoother and more productive.

5. Customization and Fine-Tuning 
   By adjusting prompts strategically, users can tailor responses to their specific needs, whether for technical support, creative writing, coding, or business applications.

6. Guiding AI Behavior 
   Prompt engineering can shape the tone, depth, and complexity of responses, ensuring alignment with the user's goals, whether they need a simple explanation or a deep technical breakdown.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: 
"Write about technology."

Improved Prompt: 
"Write a 500-word article on how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, including its benefits, challenges, and future potential."  

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:  
1. Specificity – Instead of a broad topic like "technology," the improved prompt focuses on AI in healthcare.  
2. Clear Scope – It outlines what to include: benefits, challenges, and future potential.  
3. Conciseness – The word count (500 words) ensures an appropriate level of depth.  
4. Actionable – The writer knows exactly what to cover, reducing ambiguity and improving efficiency.
